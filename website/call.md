## Motivation

Affective computing is the study and development of systems and devices that can
recognize, interpret, process, and simulate human affects—i.e., the experience
of feelings or emotions. Over the past decade, research has shown the impact of
affective states on work performance and on team collaboration. This also
applies to software engineering that involves people in a broad range of
activities, where personality, moods, and emotions play a crucial role. For
successful software engineering projects, stakeholders need to experience
positive affect (such as trust or appreciation), to agree on display rules for
emotions, and to hold mutual commitment to the project goals. Recently,
researchers started to study the role of affective computing and affective
states in software engineering. However, contributions on this topic are
currently presented and discussed in diverse conferences and workshops. This
workshop follows on the fourth edition held at ICSE 2019, towards the
consolidation of an international, sustainable forum for researchers and
practitioners interested in the role of affect in software engineering to meet,
present, and discuss their work in progress. High-quality contributions about
empirical studies, theoretical models, as well as tools for supporting emotion
awareness in software engineering are invited to the workshop from both academia
and industry.

## Topics

Affective states play a crucial role in daily work since they might affect the
performance and outcome of both individual and group activities. Personality
traits, moods, and emotions contribute to the affective climate of a project or
an organization since affective states are experienced continuously and
communicated through direct or computer-mediated interactions. Leveraging
emotion awareness in software engineering could enhance the development
performance, quality of software, mood regulation within a project team, and
fruitful interactions with all stakeholders involved in the software engineering
domain. This workshop will identify and address challenges posed by emotion
awareness in software engineering. Topics of interest include, but are not
limited to:

*   Impact of affective states (emotions, moods, attitudes, personality traits)
    on individual and group performance, commitment and collaboration in
    software engineering
*   The role of affect in the social programmer ecosystem
*   Leveraging stakeholders affective feedback to improve software, tools, and
    processes (e.g., sentiment analysis of users feedback, aspect-based
    sentiment analysis of product reviews, etc.)
*   Design, development, and evaluation of tools and datasets for supporting
    emotion awareness in software engineering
*   Reusable software frameworks, APIs, and patterns for designing and
    maintaining affect-aware systems
*   Ethnographic approaches to affect monitoring in the workplace of software
    projects
*   Psychology of programming and modeling of affective states (e.g.,
    psychological models of affect in software engineering, understanding the
    trigger behind emotions during developers activities, etc.)
*   Affective state detection from multimodal analysis of spontaneous
    communicative behavior such as natural language processing, use of biometric
    measurements, analysis of body posture and gesture, speech analysis
*   Affect sensing from communication artifacts (e.g., message boards, issue
    tracking, social media)
*   Methodologies for large-scale emotion mining
*   Emotion awareness in requirements engineering, software design, and software
    management
*   Emotion awareness in software design philosophies, development practices,
    and tools
*   Emotion awareness of developers of different genders, cultures, ages
*   Emotion awareness in cross-cultural teams in global software development
*   Methodologies and standards
*   Replications of prior studies

## Types of Contributions and Format Guidelines

We invite three kinds of submissions:

*   Full papers (6&nbsp;pages) describing emotion awareness challenges, needs,
    novel approaches, and frameworks. New approaches must be evaluated with
    users in this category. Empirical evaluation papers and industrial
    experience reports are also welcome.
*   Short papers (3-4&nbsp;pages) describing new ideas, works in progress,
    datasets/artifacts, or tools/demos.
*   Posters (1-2&nbsp;pages) summarizing research
    projects, demos, techniques.

<!-- Artifact and demo papers may be either long or short papers depending on the -->
<!-- level of maturity they are at. We especially encourage evaluation of systems on -->
<!-- publicly available benchmark datasets such as the [Jira -->
<!-- dataset](https://doi.org/10.1145/2901739.2903505), [Stack Overflow gold standard -->
<!-- on emotions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02300), and sentiment analysis datasets. -->

<!-- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10664-017-9546-9#Sec7 -->
We encourage the submission of negative results as well as study design which can be evaluated with the participants in a _live study_ session taking place during the workshop.

All papers must be in English and must conform, at time of submission, to [the ICSE
formatting guidelines for Technical
Research (see _How to submit_)](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2020/icse-2020-papers#Call-for-Papers). Papers
must be submitted electronically, in PDF format. The submission site is hosted
by EasyChair and can be accessed
[here](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=semotion20).

Three members from the international program committee will review each
submission. Papers will be evaluated based on their originality, relevance to
the workshop, and their potential for discussion. The papers with the best
reviews will be accepted to be presented at the workshop. All accepted papers
will be distributed to workshop participants and will be invited to be included
in a workshop proceedings published in the ACM and IEEE CS Digital Libraries.

## Live Studies

This year, we would like to invite the workshop attendees to voluntarily engage in a "live study." A live study can be, for example, a (controlled) experiment, an (online) survey, a user study, a focus group relevant to the topics of the workshop.

Live study proposals (max 6 pages) should address at least the following items.

1) Plan and Design
- Research goal
- Research questions, including any hypothesis
- Research method(s) (e.g., experiment, online survey, focus group study)
- Population of interest (i.e., target of generalisation)
- Description or profile of the subjects, such as experience, background, etc.
- Study design (depending on the research methods)
- Equipment and infrastructure needed for performing the study (PCs, software, flipcharts)
- Type of data that will be collected
- Type of analysis that will be carried out on the gathered data
- Anticipated threats to the validity of the results and possible mitigation procedures
- Ethical issues (e.g., informed consent, confidentiality and privacy, fair treatment of subjects)

2) Relevance and Feasibility
- Relevance of study for research and/or for practice
- Benefits to the subjects of participating in the study, including incentives
- Plan to make publicity of the study if selected, and to attract participants
- Plant for disseminating preliminary results with the attendees after the workshop

3) About the researchers
- Record of past empirical studies performed by the submitters
- Role of the proposed study in the submitter's research agenda (e.g., plans for replications, hypothesis based on the researcher's previous experience)

Live study submissions will be reviewed based on:

- Relevance to the workshop topics
- Soundness and feasibility of the proposal
- Potential for attracting a suitable number of participants
- Impact on the advancement of the submitter's research plan

A link to a complete description of the protocol must be included in the camera-ready version of accepted submissions.

During the workshop, the authors of the accepted proposals will introduce their study to the participants and conduct it according to the proposed plan.
